## Description

`PopGenAnalysis` is an R package is to view various different plots for
different types of population genomic data. Currently there arenâ€™t many
packages that display different plots for different types of population
genomic data. This package will help in doing so.

## Installation

You can install the development version of PopGenAnalysis from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Heffley/PopGenAnalysis")
library("PopGenAnalysis")
```

## Overview

``` r
ls("package:PopGenAnalysis")
```

PopGenAnalysis contains 3 different functions that plot population
genomics data

The *pcaPopulationPlot* function takes a data set of NUMERIC attributes
and creates a plot to see how related the species are

The *hwHeatPlot* function generates the plot heatmap showing significant
departures from HWE where the pink values are where p are less than or
equal to alpha.

The *provestiDistDendo* function will display a dendogram of random n
individuals/populations to visualize a genetic distance with a given
data set.

## Contributions

The author of the package is Jeffrey Chen.

The *pcaPopulationPlot* uses ggbiplot function from `ggbiplot` R package
to generate PCA plots.
